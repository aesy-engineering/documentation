     <Step title="Add the tracking details">
        1. Add GTM tag, should look like `G-XXXXXX`
        2. Add Pixel Analytics Tracking ID
        3. Add redirect params, you can add more that one
        <Note>
        These are the params that will be sent when a user is redirected to the shop once they choose a product.
        eg: If you want `?utm_source=reco_quiz&utm_campaign=toys`, you should put the string `utm_source:reco_quiz,utm_campaign:toys`
